# HollowGraham

This is a program I wrote so that I would never lose my keys again.  Basically, you tell it where you keep your stuff and it will remember for you.  Forget where you left your keys?  If you'd told Hollow Graham where they were, you'd have them by now!

# USAGE: (COMMAND LINE ONLY)

start the program in a python environment (eg: `python HollowGraham.py`) and follow the on-screen display.

# NOTE:

This software is a 'semifinished' product -- there's a lot of debug code in there and it will print hundreds of lines of garbage while performing simple commands.  These can be muted by going through the source and commenting out the lines with the print commands on them, however I've left them in so that in the unlikely scenario that HollowGraham crashes and loses the locations of everything you own, you can go back through the output and rebuild your ~/.HollowGraham.obj object storage file.
